Pacific Ocean Playground is an educational game platform for young teenagers that celebrates the Pacific Ocean. Teens can track their improvement through metrics on their profile and compare their scores to their friends.

Pacific Ocean Playground was my final portfolio piece for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. It was built using AngularJS, Javascript, Sails.js, MongoDB, Node.js, CSS and HTML.
